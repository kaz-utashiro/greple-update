# NAME

update - Greple module to update file content

# SYNOPSIS

greple -Mupdate

Options:

    --update       replace file content
    --with-backup  make backup files

    --diff         produce diff output
    -U#            specify unified diff context length

    --discard      simply discard the output

# VERSION

Version 1.03

# DESCRIPTION

This **greple** module substitute the target file content by command
output.  For example, next command replace all words in the file to
uppercase.

    greple -Mupdate '\w+' --cm 'sub{uc}' --update file

Above is a very simple example but you can implement arbitrarily
complex function in conjunction with other various **greple** options.

You can check how the file will be edited by **--diff** option.

    greple -Mupdate '\w+' --cm 'sub{uc}' --diff file

Command **sdif** or **cdif** would be useful to see the difference
visually.

    greple -Mupdate '\w+' --cm 'sub{uc}' --diff file | cdif

This module has been spun off from [App::Greple::subst](https://metacpan.org/pod/App%3A%3AGreple%3A%3Asubst) module.
Consult it for more practical use case.

# OPTIONS

There are two kinds of options for this module, such as `--diff` and
`--update::diff`.  This is to avoid option name conflicts when used
in combination with other modules.  If you are using this module from
another module and want to use the `--diff` option in it, call as
`--update::diff`.

- **--update**
- **--update::update**

    Update the target file by command output.  Entire file content is
    produced and any color effects are canceled.  Without this option,
    **greple** behaves as normal operation, that means only matched lines
    are printed.

    File is not touched as far as its content does not change.

    The file is also not updated if the output is empty.  This is to
    prevent the contents of the file from being erased if none of the
    match strings are included.  If you want to intentionally empty a
    file, you need to think of another way.

- **--with-backup**\[=_suffix_\]

    Backup original file with `.bak` suffix.  If optional parameter is
    given, it is used as a suffix string.  If the file exists, `.bak_1`,
    `.bak_2` ... are used.

- **--discard**
- **--update::discard**

    Simply discard the command output without updating file.  This option
    can be used when the output of the command is not needed and only side
    effects are expected.

- **--diff**
- **--update::diff**

    Option **-diff** produce diff output of original and converted text.
    Option **-U#** can be used to specify context length.
